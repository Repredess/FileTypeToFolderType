# FileTypeToFolderType
Simple program to stack your files by their extension

You can choose your folders by 3 different ways:

1) By default, there is a choice of folders through the console
2) You can also put the folders you are interested in via a JSON file.
3) Just write your addresses in variables: folder_track and folder_dest

IMPORTANT!!!  If you chose the method you need, then comment out the other 2 for correct work.
